A smart desk dashboard that integrates real-time weather data, NTP time synchronization, and a persistent task management system. This project features a built-in web server allowing for wireless control via a smartphone or PC.Key FeaturesNTP Time Sync: Automatically fetches millisecond-accurate time from pool.ntp.org, eliminating the need for an external RTC module.Live Weather: Uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display current temperature and conditions for Ottawa.Persistent Task List: Implements LittleFS to store up to 10 tasks in the ESP32's flash memory so data is saved after power loss.Web Portal: A local web server handles HTTP POST requests to add or delete tasks from a mobile browser.Smart Refresh: Optimized drawing logic only refreshes the TFT screen when values change, preventing screen flicker.Hardware ComponentsMCU: ESP32 DevKit V1Display: ST7789 240x320 TFT (GMT020-02)Storage: Internal Flash (via LittleFS)Pinout ConfigurationTFT PinESP32 PinFunctionCSGPIO 5Chip SelectRSTGPIO 4ResetDCGPIO 2Data/CommandMOSIGPIO 23Master Out Slave InSCLKGPIO 18Serial ClockSetup InstructionsOpen the project in the Arduino IDE.Ensure you have the following libraries installed: Adafruit GFX, Adafruit ST7789, and ArduinoJson.Replace the Wi-Fi and API placeholders in the code with your local credentials.
